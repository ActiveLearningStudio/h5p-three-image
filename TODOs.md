# Remaining work
- Rewrite to use React
- Make sure that each scene is a separate content type so that it may be copy/pasta'd
- Ensure good accessibility
- Ensure browser support
- Write unit tests
- Write integration tests
- Make it work with full-screen
- Make sure device orientation/motion sensors works


# Nice to have
- Navigational map for end-user
- "return to start"/"panic" button
- Different size for icons
- Different icons for hotspots
- Different icons for different interactions
- Fade out/in sounds/audio tracks
- Explain sphere segmentation better
- Test if this easily can be translated to VR-goggles
